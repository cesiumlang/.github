> A compiled, statically-typed systems programming language designed for mathematical computing and linear algebra applications.

## Overview

Cesium is a performance-oriented programming language that prioritizes explicit memory management, mathematical expressiveness, and C ABI compatibility. Drawing inspiration from languages like C, Zig, MATLAB, Python, Fortran, Rust, Go, and Odin, Cesium provides a modern approach to systems programming with first-class support for mathematical operations.

The language name is a reference to the atomic element cesium (American Chemical Society spelling). Since one of the primary objectives is runtime performance, it seemed fitting to share a name with the element used in atomic clocks - where a second is officially defined by the Cs-133 atom's hyperfine transition frequency of exactly 9,192,631,770 Hz.

## Key Features

- **üßÆ Math-first Design**: Built-in mathematical operators and types optimized for numerical computing
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Compile-time dispatch, static optimization, and predictable performance characteristics
- **üõ°Ô∏è Memory Safety**: Ownership tracking and compile-time borrow checking with explicit memory management
- **üîó C Interoperability**: Seamless integration with existing C libraries and systems
- **üìù Clear Syntax**: ASCII-only syntax for universal accessibility and readability
- **üéØ Static Typing**: Strong type system with minimal implicit conversions

### Design Goals

- Explicit control over memory management and performance characteristics
- Mathematical expressiveness through context-aware operators
- Memory safety without garbage collection overhead
- Strong typing with compile-time verification
- Universal accessibility through ASCII-only syntax
- Production-ready systems programming capabilities

## Quick Start

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Cesium:

```cesium
// hello.cs
void = main() {
  printf("Hello, Cesium!\n");
}
```
